# Recommender System

##### Physical objects occupy space

- Brick-and-mortar shops must satisfy physical constraints
- Curators must prioritize for some notion of utility
- Serving the most customers, maximizing sales/profit, etc.

##### This is not true for digital items!

- The web, e-books, news article, movies, music, ... take up no physical space
- Without curation, this quickly becomes overwhelming
